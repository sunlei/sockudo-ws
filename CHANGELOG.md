## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- **Breaking:** native io_uring read/write methods now require mutable access to preserve ordering with poll I/O. Direct I/O through get_ref bypasses the bridge and is outside this ordering contract.

- Outbound frames are coalesced across `send()` calls while inbound messages
  that were already parsed are still queued for the application
  (`Config::write_coalescing`, default on). A read batch of N messages
  answered with N sends is one vectored write instead of N; everything is
  written before the stream next waits on the transport, so no reply is
  delayed past the end of its batch. Disable with
  `Config::builder().write_coalescing(false)`.
- Server-side data payloads of 8 KiB or more are queued by reference behind
  their frame header and sent with vectored I/O instead of being copied into
  the write buffer (`CorkBuffer::push_segment`, `cork::ZERO_COPY_MIN`).
- `CorkBuffer` is now an ordered list of `Bytes` segments plus an open tail
  buffer; `write_bytes` keeps output order and `write` no longer spills into a
  separate overflow queue.
- `SplitWriter` / `CompressedSplitWriter` write directly to the transport
  through a sink shared with the connection's control driver, instead of a
  channel plus a oneshot completion per `send()`. Automatic Pong/Ping/Close
  frames interleave at frame boundaries. `SplitWriter::send` now requires
  `S: AsyncWrite + Unpin` (which `split()` already required).
- Frame masking uses an auto-vectorised 64-byte block loop on aarch64 and
  other non-x86 targets (aligned above 2 KiB): 1 KiB 53 -> 84 GB/s,
  16 KiB 67 -> 127 GB/s, 64 B 12 -> 19 GB/s on an Apple M5 Pro.
- Compio streams and split readers reuse the message Vec across reads, pop
  messages instead of cloning them, and publish inbound activity through a
  shared cell instead of a channel message per data frame.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-09-19

### Added

- Added custom HTTP headers to Tokio and Compio HTTP/1.1 client handshakes, with validation that
  prevents malformed fields and conflicts with handshake-managed headers
  (`build_request_with_headers`, `client_handshake_with_headers`, `connect_with_headers`,
  `connect_raw_with_headers`, `connect_to_url_with_headers`, `connect_async_with_headers`). (#17)

### Changed

- The `rustls-*` features no longer select a crypto provider. `rustls` is depended on with only
  `std`, and `tokio-rustls` with `logging` and `tls12`. Applications must enable exactly one
  provider (`ring` or `aws-lc-rs`) on their own direct `rustls` dependency; see the README.
  Sockudo's tests select Ring through a dev-dependency. (#11)

### Fixed

- permessage-deflate with context takeover (`Compression::Dedicated` and the `WindowNKB` modes)
  silently corrupted or killed the stream after any message that did not shrink when compressed:
  the raw message stayed in the sender's LZ77 window but never entered the peer's. Such messages are
  now always sent compressed under context takeover, costing ~6 bytes on incompressible frames. (#14)
- Preserved WebSocket frame bytes read together with Tokio HTTP/1.1 upgrade requests or responses,
  including when the stream is split immediately after connecting. (#17)

## [2.0.2] - 2026-09-19

### Fixed

- Fragmented text messages were re-validated as UTF-8 over the whole
  accumulated message on every fragment (O(n·k)); a 4 MiB text message in
  64-byte fragments (Autobahn 9.3.1) took ~30 s of server CPU. Text is now
  validated incrementally in one linear pass (`utf8::Utf8Stream`).
- Invalid UTF-8 is rejected as soon as it arrives, including mid-frame
  (Autobahn 6.4.x now STRICT). The frame parser unmasks payload bytes as they
  arrive and exposes them via `FrameParser::pending_payload`.
- `WebSocketStream` / `CompressedWebSocketStream` re-created the heartbeat
  timer on every inbound message (v2.0.1 regression). One timer per stream is
  now re-armed lazily; steady-state cost per message is zero timer operations.
- The split reader no longer sends an activity message through the writer
  channel for every inbound data frame; it publishes the inactivity clock via
  an atomic. `ControlRequest::Activity` was removed (internal).
- The split writer driver re-registered its heartbeat sleep on every loop
  iteration; it now keeps a single `Sleep`.
- Removed per-read `Vec<Message>` allocation and per-message `Message` clone
  in the streams and split readers; removed the `Vec<IoSlice>` allocation per
  flush (`CorkBuffer::fill_write_slices`).
- Read buffer regrowth now reserves `RECV_BUFFER_SIZE` instead of 8 KiB, so
  reads are no longer capped at ~8 KiB once the buffer has been shared out.
- Handshake header parsing no longer allocates a `String` per header, and
  `Upgrade` / `Connection` are matched as comma-separated tokens.

### Added

- `utf8::Utf8Stream`, `frame::PendingPayload`, `FrameParser::pending_payload`,
  `CorkBuffer::fill_write_slices`.
- `docs/PERFORMANCE_AUDIT.md` with measurements against tokio-tungstenite and
  the Autobahn suite.

## [2.0.1] - 2026-07-25

### Added

- Added correlated native WebSocket keepalive for Tokio and Compio, including
  plain/compressed unified streams, split streams, Axum, and generic
  TCP/TLS/HTTP transport wrappers.
- Added `Config::{pong_timeout,pong_timeout_close_code,
  pong_timeout_close_reason,close_timeout}` and their builder methods.
- Added typed `Error::HeartbeatTimeout` and `Error::IdleTimeout` causes.
- Added deterministic heartbeat state-machine, Tokio split-driver, Axum
  plain/permessage-deflate, masking, Close, and Compio control-driver tests.

### Changed

- `ping_interval` is now an inbound-inactivity interval rather than a fixed
  cadence. One nonce-bearing Ping may be outstanding; only its exact Pong
  clears the deadline.
- `idle_timeout` now implements its documented hard inbound-idle deadline.
  `Config::uws_defaults()` disables that independent deadline so it cannot
  close before its first keepalive Ping.
- Split writers are bounded command handles. A connection-scoped driver owns
  the transport writer and prioritizes automatic Pong, Close, and heartbeat
  traffic even when the application performs no writes.
- Split readers expose Ping and Pong messages after automatic protocol work.

### Compatibility

- Existing builder-based configuration and `split()` call sites keep the same
  method-level API. Tokio split transports must now be `Send + 'static`
  because the writer driver is connection-scoped Tokio work.
- Adding public `Config` fields is source-breaking for downstream exhaustive
  struct literals; use `Config::builder()` or `..Config::default()`. Adding
  typed public `Error` variants is source-breaking for exhaustive matches.
  These changes are intentional so timeout causes are not collapsed into EOF.

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-24

### Highlights

- Added native Compio support alongside Tokio, including WebSocket handshakes,
  plain and compressed streams, split readers/writers, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, and
  multiplexed connections.
- Made HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 transport features runtime-neutral so they can be
  paired with either `tokio-runtime` or `compio-runtime`.
- Fixed read-only WebSocket consumers so automatic Pong and Close responses
  are flushed without requiring the caller to drive the Sink side.
- Activated the existing `auto_ping` and `ping_interval` settings so a polled
  read loop sends periodic Ping frames even while its peer is silent.

### Added

- `compio-runtime` feature with Compio-native completion-based APIs.
- Portable Compio polling driver enabled by default through the
  `compio-runtime` feature.
- Runtime and transport end-to-end tests for HTTP/1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3, and
  multiplexed WebSockets across Tokio and Compio.
- A `wtx_bench_echo` example and expanded runtime/transport documentation.

### Changed

- Runtime selection is separate from transport selection. When default
  features are disabled, select `tokio-runtime` or `compio-runtime` explicitly
  and combine it with `http2` or `http3` as needed.
- HTTP/2 Extended CONNECT requests now use the h2 protocol extension API.
- HTTP/3 stream construction retains the connection handles needed by
  multiplexed and long-lived streams.
- Examples, binaries, and benchmarks declare the runtime features they require.
- Corrected benchmark reproduction instructions in the README.

### Fixed

- Incoming Ping frames now flush their automatic Pong before `poll_next`
  yields the Ping to a read-only consumer.
- Incoming Close frames now flush the Close response before the stream reports
  itself closed.
- Compio no longer compiles with a stub driver that panics when creating a
  runtime.

## [1.5.1] - 2026-01-02

### Fixed

- Clippy warnings: allow `large_enum_variant` for `StreamInner` (boxing adds indirection overhead)
- Clippy warnings: collapse nested if statements using let-chains in `extended_connect.rs`

## [1.5.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added

- **mimalloc feature**: Optional high-performance allocator for 10-30% throughput improvement
  - Enable with `features = ["mimalloc"]`
  - Automatically sets mimalloc as the global allocator

### Changed

- **Unified Transport API**: Major refactoring of HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 APIs
  - `H2WebSocketServer` → `WebSocketServer<Http2>`
  - `H3WebSocketServer` → `WebSocketServer<Http3>`
  - `H2WebSocketClient` → `WebSocketClient<Http2>`
  - `H3WebSocketClient` → `WebSocketClient<Http3>`
  - New `Transport` trait with `Http1`, `Http2`, `Http3` marker types
  - Shared `ExtendedConnectRequest`/`ExtendedConnectResponse` types
  - `MultiplexedConnection` for HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 stream multiplexing

- **Stream type renames**:
  - `H2Stream` → `Http2Stream`
  - `H3Stream` → `Http3Stream`

### Removed

- **Unused custom allocators**: Removed `src/alloc.rs` containing unused `SlabPool`, `Arena`, and `BufferPool`
  - These were never integrated into the codebase
  - Use the `slab` crate from tokio-rs if slab allocation is needed

### Migration Guide

```rust
// Before (1.4.x)
use sockudo_ws::http2::H2WebSocketServer;
let server = H2WebSocketServer::new(config);

// After (1.5.0)
use sockudo_ws::{WebSocketServer, Http2};
let server = WebSocketServer::<Http2>::new(config);
```

## [1.4.3] - 2026-01-01

### Fixed

- Critical bug: Misaligned pointer dereference in scalar masking fallback
  - The alignment check was incorrectly using `(i + mask_idx) & 7` instead of checking actual pointer address
  - Could cause panics on architectures that enforce pointer alignment when casting to `*mut u64`
  - Now correctly checks `(ptr_addr + i) & 7` to ensure 8-byte alignment before u64 operations
  - Discovered through fuzzing with cargo-fuzz

## [1.4.2] - 2026-01-01

### Added

- Custom SSE2 UTF-8 validation for x86/x86_64 CPUs without SSE4.2 support
  - `simdutf8` crate only supports SSE4.2+ (introduced in 2008)
  - New SSE2 implementation provides SIMD acceleration for older CPUs (SSE2 available since 2001)
  - Uses ASCII fast-path detection: checks if all bytes in 16-byte chunks are ASCII (< 0x80)
  - Falls back to `simdutf8` when SSE4.2+ is available for optimal performance
  - No feature flags required, works on stable Rust

### Fixed

- Clippy warnings: removed unnecessary `return` statements in UTF-8 validation dispatch
- Clippy warnings: simplified redundant closures in benchmarks

## [1.4.1] - 2026-01-01

### Changed

- Updated all dependencies to latest versions with `^` for automatic compatible updates:
  - tokio: ^1.48
  - rustls: ^0.23
  - tokio-rustls: ^0.26
  - webpki-roots: ^1.0 (major version bump)
  - rustls-native-certs: ^0.8
  - rustls-platform-verifier: ^0.6
  - quinn: ^0.11
  - h3: ^0.0.8, h3-quinn: ^0.0.10

### Fixed

- CI build failure caused by rustls-platform-verifier 0.4 incompatibility with webpki::Error trait bounds

## [1.4.0] - 2026-01-01

### Added

- Custom SIMD UTF-8 validation for architectures not covered by simdutf8:
  - LoongArch64 (LSX/LASX) with ASCII fast-path optimization
  - PowerPC/PowerPC64 (AltiVec) with ASCII fast-path optimization
  - s390x (z13 vectors) with ASCII fast-path optimization
- All custom implementations require the `nightly` feature flag

### Implementation Details

ASCII fast-path strategy: Check if all bytes in a 16/32-byte chunk have high bit unset (< 0x80). If pure ASCII, skip validation for that chunk; if non-ASCII, fall back to scalar validation.
